### Description
T1569.002 (Service Execution) is a sub-technique of T1569 (System Services). 
Based on MITRE, how many threat groups other than FerRat utilize both Service Execution and T1059?
Remember to add TG22{...} around the solution.

### Solution
1. Copy everything from the respective "procedure examples" into this online compare tool: https://www.ddginc-usa.com/text-compare-tool.htm
2. Select "side-by-side" or "inline"
3. Note all the white rows indicating similarities

As read from MTIRES procedure examples:
* G APT32
* G APT39
* S Empire
* G Fin6
* S ghost RAT 
* G Ke3chang

The list shows a total of 4 threat groups

### Common mistake
6
- Note that the text is asking for threat groups only, not software (empire, ghost RAT)
