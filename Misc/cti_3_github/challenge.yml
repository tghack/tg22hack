    SecOpsCommand have gotten information from a third party indicating that the threat actor we call FerRAT downloads software from GitHub to the victims machine after initial access.
    The third party did not specify the software, and is gone for easter holiday.
    Based on information from the report, can you figure out the software name?
    Remember to add TG22{...} around the solution.
